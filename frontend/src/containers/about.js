            <p>
              Amy is a speech language pathologist with expertise in pediatric
              feeding and swallowing disorders, particularly with respect to
              instrumental examination with the videofluoroscopic swallowing
              study (VFSS). She has more than 25 years’ experience conducting
              VFSSs for babies and children, dating back to the very first study
              at Seattle Children’s Hospital. Amy also works as a feeding
              specialist in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and on an
              outpatient basis at Valley Medical Center's Children's Therapy.
              Sharing her passion for assessment and treatment of
              feeding/swallowing issues, Amy has instructed at the university
              level at multiple universities and presented regionally,
              nationally, and internationally. Amy co-authored a chapter titled
              “Issues in Pediatric Feeding & Swallowing” with Gay Lloyd Pinder,
              PhD, CCC-SLP [1], and has also published several other articles
              about pediatric swallowing and NICU best practices. Amy’s approach
              to working with children and families is centered on making
              mealtimes safe, fun and a positive experience for all. She finds
              it a wondrous, rewarding experience to help tiny, fragile infants
              learn how to safely bottle or breastfeed, and to help
              understandably overwhelmed parents and children transform into
              happy, thriving families as the infant/child's feeding skills and
              overall medical status improves. Amy lives in the greater Seattle
              area with her husband Jeff. She loves laughing with family and
              friends, travelling, entertaining and playing at the lake. [1]

              Carol is founder of the TOFT House in Everett, Washington, a
              dedicated space where feeding therapy takes place in an
              environment that mirrors home, and families undergo the transition
              from g-tube to oral feedings in a natural environment. She has a
              special interest in the social aspect of feeding and how it
              sustains and enhances relationships. Carol has chosen to work with
              children with feeding issues because of her desire to help make
              family life less stressful for parents and children. She loves to
              see a whole new world open before them when feeding is a positive,
              fun experience. Carol goes by her middle name “Lorioux.” She used
              to work in a restaurant and is a salsa queen. In her spare time,
              she loves to surf.

            <p>
              Judy is in private practice, but works in office-based and
              hospital settings. She specializes in helping neonates and young
              infants avoid long-term feeding issues. Having raised two
              children, her philosophy is one of compassion to help families
              avoid unnecessary stress that can be avoided by professional help.
              She focuses on “no tears for mothers, fathers, or babies” and
              formulating plans to help reduce stress in the feeding
              relationship. Judy co-founded the special needs program at the
              Washington Academy of Performing Arts to help children with
              physical challenges experience the joys of dance. She has also
              taught classes on oral motor/feeding at Overlake Hospital Medical
              Center in Bellevue, Washington, to the King County public health
              department, and career counseling conferences. In addition to
              helping children and families with feeding, Judy loves to visit
              her own grandbaby and plans to travel the world to see all 22 Jan
              Vermeer paintings and attend one of each of the four types of
              Grand Slam tennis tournaments with her husband and best friend,
              Scott.

              occupational therapists, physical therapist, and speech language
              pathologists at a Washington state Birth-to-Three center. She
              enjoys helping infants become oral feeders so they are no longer
              in need of their g-tubes. Because eating is such a significant
              component of family life, Gay finds that helping kids have a safe,
              fun experience with meals is one of the most important
              developmental skills a therapist can address. Gay applies her
              background in Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT) to help children
              who have feeding issues and/or gross motor challenges. Although
              indirectly related to her focus on feeding, Gay enjoys gardening
              and travel. She grows vegetables and only travels to places that
              have amazing food, so having pleasurable experiences with food
              ranks high in both her professional and personal life!

              Children’s Hospital Growth and Feeding Dynamics clinic and
              Occupational Therapy department. She also serves as the organizer
              for the Pediatric Feeding Association, coordinating planning
              committees and communications about upcoming meetings and
              professional development opportunities. With almost 35 years of
              experience in working with children with feeding issues, she has
              treated many aspects of difficulty with feeding, and has
              particular expertise in working with children transitioning from
              tube feeding to oral eating. For Karen, it is a privilege to be
              invited to share in the family dynamics of mealtimes, and to be a
              part of the true joy that accompanies the process of a child
              learning to eat. Karen advocates for a multi-disciplinary,
              team-based approach to helping children and families, and has
              formed a strong partnership with feeding professionals and parents
              to develop Seattle Children’s Hospital’s Intensive Feeding
              program. When she’s not at Seattle Children’s Hospital, she enjoys
              tap dancing and hiking with her husband. She has three wonderful
              daughters who are now young adults, and appreciates any time she
              can spend with them.

              feeding complications, including a swallowing and vomiting
              disorder, which led to g-tube placement. Having received treatment
              for Kai from numerous members of the Pediatric Feeding

              Interest Feeding Group into the Pediatric Feeding Association.
              Together with her husband, Ed, they founded pedsfeeds.com to
              better connect medical, therapeutic, mental health, and nutrition
              professionals to provide comprehensive support for families as
