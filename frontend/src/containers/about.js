            <Media.Heading>Amy Faherty</Media.Heading>
            <p>
            Amy is a speech language pathologist with expertise in pediatric feeding and swallowing disorders, particularly with respect to instrumental examination with the videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and Fiberoptic Endoscopy Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). She has more than 30 years’ experience conducting VFSSs for babies and children. In addition, she now serves as a speech-language pathologist (SLP) swallowing specialist on the tertiary multidisciplinary Aerodigestive Clinic team at Seattle Children’s hospital. Since 2014, Amy has also worked as an infant feeding specialist in the University of Washington Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Sharing her passion for assessment and treatment of feeding/swallowing issues, Amy has instructed at the university level at multiple universities and presented regionally, nationally, and internationally. Amy has several publications related to pediatric swallowing, dysphagia research and NICU best practices.
            Amy’s approach to working with children and families is centered on making mealtimes safe, fun, and a positive experience for all. She finds it a wondrous, rewarding experience to help tiny, fragile infants learn how to safely bottle or breastfeed, and to help understandably overwhelmed parents and children transform into happy, thriving families as the infant/child's feeding skills and overall medical status improves. Amy lives in the greater Seattle area with her husband Jeff. She loves laughing with family and friends, traveling, entertaining and playing at the lake.

            <p>
              Carol is founder of the TOFT House in Everett, Washington, a
              dedicated space where feeding therapy takes place in an
              environment that mirrors home, and families undergo the transition
              from g-tube to oral feedings in a natural environment. She has a
              special interest in the social aspect of feeding and how it
              sustains and enhances relationships. Carol has chosen to work with
              children with feeding issues because of her desire to help make
              family life less stressful for parents and children. She loves to
              see a whole new world open before them when feeding is a positive,
              fun experience. Carol goes by her middle name “Lorioux.” She used
              to work in a restaurant and is a salsa queen. In her spare time,
              she loves to surf.

            <p>
              Judy is in private practice, but works in office-based and
              hospital settings. She specializes in helping neonates and young
              infants avoid long-term feeding issues. Having raised two
              children, her philosophy is one of compassion to help families
              avoid unnecessary stress that can be avoided by professional help.
              She focuses on “no tears for mothers, fathers, or babies” and
              formulating plans to help reduce stress in the feeding
              relationship. Judy co-founded the special needs program at the
              Washington Academy of Performing Arts to help children with
              physical challenges experience the joys of dance. She has also
              taught classes on oral motor/feeding at Overlake Hospital Medical
              Center in Bellevue, Washington, to the King County public health
              department, and career counseling conferences. In addition to
              helping children and families with feeding, Judy loves to visit
              her own grandbaby and plans to travel the world to see all 22 Jan
              Vermeer paintings and attend one of each of the four types of
              Grand Slam tennis tournaments with her husband and best friend,
              Scott.

              Children’s Hospital Growth and Feeding Dynamics clinic and
              Occupational Therapy department. She also serves as the organizer
              for the Pediatric Feeding Association, coordinating planning
              committees and communications about upcoming meetings and
              professional development opportunities. With almost 35 years of
              experience in working with children with feeding issues, she has
              treated many aspects of difficulty with feeding, and has
              particular expertise in working with children transitioning from
              tube feeding to oral eating. For Karen, it is a privilege to be
              invited to share in the family dynamics of mealtimes, and to be a
              part of the true joy that accompanies the process of a child
              learning to eat. Karen advocates for a multi-disciplinary,
              team-based approach to helping children and families, and has
              formed a strong partnership with feeding professionals and parents
              to develop Seattle Children’s Hospital’s Intensive Feeding
              program. When she’s not at Seattle Children’s Hospital, she enjoys
              tap dancing and hiking with her husband. She has three wonderful
              daughters who are now young adults, and appreciates any time she
              can spend with them.

            Maria is the mother of Kai, who is the inspiration behind her service to the Pediatric Feeding Association. Born three months early, Kai has faced a host of feeding complications, including a swallowing and vomiting disorder, which led to g-tube placement. Recognizing the importance of timely access to the right services, Maria wanted to further develop and expand the network of professionals and services available to families. As part of that work, she helped facilitate the evolution of the Special Interest Feeding Group into the Pediatric Feeding Association. Together with her husband, Ed, they created the pedsfeeds.com website to better connect medical, therapeutic, mental health, and nutrition professionals to offer comprehensive support for families as they undertake the long and difficult journey of helping their children stabilize, grow, and gain weight while forming positive relationships with food, with family mealtimes, and most importantly, with the people who love them. She is founder of Inside Out Care, a patient program platform that allows health care teams to launch programs, enroll patients, and maximize care for families.
