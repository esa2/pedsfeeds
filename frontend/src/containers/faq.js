          <strong>Who can submit a listing in the directory?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionals in the following categories who work with pediatric
          feeding issues and who are in good standing with their state and
          national licensing and certification bodies may submit a listing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical providers</li>

          <strong>Does Pediatric Feeding Association endorse specific providers?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          No. Users are urged to exercise independent judgment and request
          references when considering any resource associated with diagnosis or
          treatment of feeding issues, or the provision of any services related
          to feeding and swallowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I find the right resources to help my child?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeding issues are often complex, so we believe the best approach to
          finding help for your child’s feeding and swallowing issues involves
          gathering perspectives from variety of disciplines, and determining
          what works best for your child and family. As a starting point, we
          recommend you consult with the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A doctor familiar with pediatric feeding issues.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This may be your pediatrician, family care doctor, or a specialist
            in gastroenterology (GI), otolaryngology, pulmonology, or
            rehabilitation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>A feeding therapist.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This can be a speech language pathologist, occupational therapist,
            physical therapist, or behavioral psychologist that specializes in
            issues associated with pediatric feeding.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>A registered dietitian.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We encourage working with a registered dietitian who understands the
            complexity of nourishing children with feeding issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>A counselor.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          to help your family cope with the stress and challenges of feeding
          challenges, which can be very time consuming and disruptive to family
          routines and stability.
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I submit a listing if I work in two locations, or if my
            services cross two categories (e.g. feeding therapy and mental
            health support?)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please submit two separate listings in the directory to allow families
          and referring providers to more easily locate you for services.

          About the Pediatric Feeding Association
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong> How did this group get started?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pediatric Feeding Association is a multidisciplinary, grass roots
          organization that formed in 2011, out of a desire to better connect
          feeding professionals and improve knowledge sharing and treatment
          solutions offered to families. This community of practice evolved out
          of an existing group known as the Feeding Special Interest Group,
          which was founded in Seattle in May 2000. Currently, the group is
          facilitated by a parent, and steered by a group of 13 pediatric
          feeding professionals. See the About Us section for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Where is the Pediatric Feeding Association located?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, we have the Washington chapter established, but would be
          happy to help you establish a local chapter. The PedsFeeds.com
          directory is currently open to licensed professionals in the United
          States only.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What level of expertise do I need to join as a member of the
            Pediatric Feeding Association?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          While experts in pediatric feeding issues are welcome to join the PFA,
          we encourage professionals with an emerging interest in working with
          pediatric feeding and swallowing issues to join so they can strengthen
          their knowledge base and share in our passion for helping children
          with feeding issues.
