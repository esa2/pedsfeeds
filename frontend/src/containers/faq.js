        </p>
        <p>
          Feeding issues are complex, so we believe the best approach to finding
          help for your childâ€™s feeding and swallowing issues involves gathering
          perspectives from variety of disciplines, and determining what works
          best for your child and family. As a starting point, we recommend you
          consult with the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A doctor familiar with pediatric feeding issues.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This may be your pediatrician, family care doctor, or a specialist
            in gastroenterology (GI), otolaryngology, pulmonology, or
            rehabilitation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>A feeding therapist.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This can be a speech language pathologist, occupational therapist,
            physical therapist, or behavioral psychologist that specializes in
            issues associated with pediatric feeding.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>A registered dietitian.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We encourage working with a registered dietitian with expertise in
            working with children with feeding issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>A counselor.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to help your family cope with the time demands and disruptive nature
            of dealing with feeding issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <strong>
            How do I submit a listing if I work in two locations, or if my
            services cross two categories (e.g. feeding therapy and mental
            health support?)
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please submit two separate listings in the directory to allow families
          and referring providers to more easily locate you for services.

          About the Pediatric Feeding Association
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong> How did this group get started?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pediatric Feeding Association is a multidisciplinary, grass roots
          organization that formed in 2011, out of a desire to better connect
          feeding professionals and improve knowledge sharing and treatment
          solutions offered to families. This community of practice evolved out
          of an existing group known as the Feeding Special Interest Group,
          which was founded in Seattle in May 2000. Currently, the group is
          facilitated by a parent, and steered by a group of 13 pediatric
          feeding professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Where is the Pediatric Feeding Association located?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, we have the Washington chapter established, but would be
          happy to help you establish a local chapter. The PedsFeeds.com
          directory is currently open to licensed professionals in the United
          States only.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What level of expertise do I need to join as a member of the
            Pediatric Feeding Association?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          While experts in pediatric feeding issues are welcome to join the PFA,
          we encourage professionals with an emerging interest in working with
          pediatric feeding and swallowing issues to join so they can strengthen
          their knowledge base and share in our passion for helping children
          with feeding issues.
